# 7 Best Resources for Elementor WordPress Page Builder

Elementor has become one of the top-rated page builders for WordPress. Elementor launched in 2016 and since then has risen to 3 million active installs. 

Updated regularly, Elementor provides excellent support as an open-source WordPress project. The affordable Pro version offers extendability that makes building WP sites a breeze (for most projects). Still, if your dream site is more complicated, Elementor is developer friendly.

We love building websites using Elementor and typically start by using their excellent Hello Theme: a minimal starter that takes care of the basics you need to get WordPress off the ground. Header, Footer, Single.php template, and that's it. Starting with Hello Theme and installing Elementor Page builder you can literally build a site. You don't need any other tools or plugins to get started. Along the way, as you expand features and get ready to launch, explore the many great resources online that may be helpful.

Below, we listed the top 7 resources online we have used over the years to build awesome, fast, secure and feature-rich small business websites.
